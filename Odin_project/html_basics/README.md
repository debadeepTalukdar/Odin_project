## 1. Document Structure

### `<!DOCTYPE html>`
The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration tells the browser to interpret the document as an HTML5 document.

### `<html>`
The `<html>` element is the root of the document, which contains all other HTML elements.

### `<head>`
The `<head>` element contains metadata about the page, such as the title, character encoding, and links to stylesheets or scripts.

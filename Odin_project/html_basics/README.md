## 1. Document Structure

### `<!DOCTYPE html>`
The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration tells the browser to interpret the document as an HTML5 document.

### `<html>`
The `<html>` element is the root of the document, which contains all other HTML elements.

### `<head>`
The `<head>` element contains metadata about the page, such as the title, character encoding, and links to stylesheets or scripts.

```html

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Project</title
</head>

```
## 2. Editing and Formatting Text

### Paragraphs (`<p>`)
The `<p>` element is used to define paragraphs of text.

### Headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`)
Headings are used to structure the content, with `<h1>` being the most important (main heading) and `<h6>` being the least.

```html
<h1>Welcome to My Project</h1>
<p>This project explains various HTML concepts.</p>
<h2>Key Features</h2>
<p>Some features of this project include learning about headings, paragraphs, links, and images.</p>

```
### 3.Adding Links and Images
Links
To create links to other websites or pages, use the <a> element.
```html
<a href="https://example.com">Visit Example</a>
```

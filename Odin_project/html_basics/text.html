    <h1>CRYPTONITE TASK PHASE</h1> <!--so h1 means heading 1 or we can say it has highest priority among all the headings (h1,h2,h3)
                                    but when we create h2 the text size will be smaller than the h1 but it doesnt mean that it is subheading of h2 in web dev we never use h2 as a subheading of h1-->


    <h2>Hello world</h2> <!--so hello world has less priority than h1 like the search engine work in GOOGLE the first lines we saw in there are the basically h1-->
    
    <p>Hello Engineers ! How's your task phase going? </p><!--So this element is used to write paragraphs-->
